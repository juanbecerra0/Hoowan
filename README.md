# Hoowan
Personal game engine project developed using C++ and OpenGL

# Overview
Hoowan is my 2D game engine developed in C++ and OpenGL. I’m following “The Cherno’s” Game Engine development YouTube series in addition to following some design paradigms from Jason Gregory’s “Game Engine Architecture”, Third Edition.
